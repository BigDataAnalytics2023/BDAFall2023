### Course Description

In this Big Data and Analytics course at George Washington University, students will embark on an
interdisciplinary journey to unlock the potential of large-scale data sets. Leveraging cutting-edge tools
and methodologies, the course covers the complete data lifecycle, from data acquisition and storage
to analysis and visualization. Designed to equip students with both theoretical knowledge and
practical skills, the course delves into real-world applications, ranging from business decision-making
to scientific research. With an emphasis on critical thinking and collaboration, students will leave the
course prepared to translate complex data into actionable insights.

### Learning outcomes
As a result of completing this course, students will be able to:

1. Data Comprehension: Equip students with the skills to identify, interpret, and analyze large
datasets, understanding their structure, limitations, and potential uses.
2. Tool Proficiency: Familiarize students with leading big data tools and technologies, such as
Hadoop, S3 Bucket, and various data storage solutions.
3. Analytical Methods: Introduce key algorithms and statistical methods essential for data
analysis, including machine learning techniques and predictive analytics.
4. Data Ethics: Instill a strong understanding of ethical considerations in data collection, storage,
and analysis, including issues of privacy, bias, and data integrity.
5. Real-world Applications: Engage students in case studies and projects that simulate real-world
challenges, thereby bridging the gap between theory and practice.
6. Collaborative Skills: Promote teamwork and interdisciplinary thinking through group projects
and discussions, preparing students for collaborative roles in a professional setting.
7. Communication: Develop students’ ability to effectively convey their findings, both written and
orally and to translate complex data analytics into understandable insights for a broader
audience.
8. Critical Thinking: Encourage students to think critically about data, questioning its sources,
relevance, and potential impacts when making analytical decisions.

### Direct and Independent Instruction Time

The course will include 2.5 hours of direct instruction each week. The lecture period will typically be split between live lecture, discussion, and in-class exercises. Asynchronous options will be available for students unable to attend lectures live. Students are expected to spend a minimum of five hours on independent learning per week.

### Grading
  * Programming Assignments (35%)
  * Quizzes (10%) 
  * Final project (45%)
  * Class Participation (10%)

### Assignments
We plan to have three programming assignments to help students learn how to deploy real Big Data System concepts in practice. Some programming assignments will be done individually, meaning students *may not* share any code with other students. In group projects, all students are expected to contribute equally.

### Programming Load
Students can use a wide range of languages such as C#, Java, Python, etc. to write code for assignments.
Also, the course will make use of several cloud services that typically involve Linux – you should be
familiar with the command line and basic Linux administration.

# Quizzes and Exams
Some weeks there will be a quiz based on the taught topics. 

### Final Project
Final projects can be done in small groups. Students will be required to design, implement and assess a
cloud-based and distributed application.

In the second half of the semester, students will work on a group project. Project proposals will need to be approved by the instructors and students will need to submit Milestone reports on a regular basis. Instead of a final exam, students will submit a final report and video presentation describing their project.

### Research Paper Report
Students will choose a topic related to the distributed system, algorithm, cloud computing and research
for reports, which can be presented in a technical report or conference paper format. Students are
required to obtain the instructor’s approval of the topic before beginning research. There will be an
extra-credit opportunity for those who are interested in writing a conference paper and submit it to
raise a final grade.

### Lecture Preparation and Participation (Bonus)


*Prep Grading:* Students will be expected to prepare in advance of lectures by reading the specified materials or watching videos. A prep-quiz before each lecture will test students’ preparation and allow them to pose questions in advance of the lecture to guide discussion. These must be completed by the deadline (usually before class) to receive credit. No late submissions will be accepted.


*Participation Grading:* Students are expected to actively participate in the class, either during the live lectures or through the online discussion system. Participation opportunities will be provided for students unable to attend lectures synchronously. Each week you can earn up to 2 participation points. You obtain 1 point each time you perform one of the following:
 - Attend a live lecture or office hour session
 - Post a question, answer, or comment on Slack or in the prep-quiz.

You can obtain your 2 points per week from any combination of the above. Participating more than twice a week is encouraged, but you can still get at most 2 points per week! Your final participation grade will allow for one week with no participation, i.e., if there are 15 weeks with participation point opportunities, then we will sum your total points earned and divide by (14\*2=28) instead of (15\*2=30).

There will also be periodic opportunities for bonus participation points -- subscribe to slack notifications to be sure you don't miss out! 

### Illness and Absence Policy
The instructors understand that students may need to be absent from class either due to illness or other personal situations. For personal situations such as being in a difficult time zone, internet connectivity issues, etc., students can watch lectures asynchronously and are still expected to participate via other means such as the course message board. 

If students anticipate missing several classes such as due to illness, they should alert the instructor as soon as possible. In this case deadlines may be extended for students and participation requirements will be relaxed.
